            <strong>Background</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Kids Code Club is a non-profit, government funded coding tutorial website aimed to help children from poor financial backgrounds gain an interest in coding through coding tutorials.
        </p>

            <strong>Project Overview</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            During my internship, I was tasked with implementing a filter system for the Kids Code Club Tutorial landing page.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked closly with the web design team as well as my manager in order to ensure that the solution would be efficient and intuitive.
        </p>
        <p class="section__subtitle">
            <strong>The Problem</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Kids Code Club employs a single landing page for all its users, granting access to a wide array of tutorials. However, due to the sheer diversity in tutorial languages, 
            difficulty levels, and topics, users encounter navigation challenges as there are no search or filtering mechanisms available. The primary objective of the landing page is to 
            facilitate users in discovering tutorials aligned with their interests. The absence of search and customization options created a notable obstacle for those seeking 
            engaging tutorial experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="section__subtitle">
            <strong>Phase One: Environment Setup</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the development of our project, we relied on a set of essential tools to establish a robust and collaborative development environment. 
            These tools, including Docker Desktop, Git Bash, and GitHub Desktop, played a pivotal role in ensuring that our development process was 
            smooth and efficient.
        </p>
        <img src="images/kcc-logos.png" alt="" class="image-container">
        <p>
            Docker Desktop was instrumental in maintaining a consistent environment across our team's machines. It allowed us 
            to create isolated containers with specific dependencies, thus eliminating the dreaded "It works on my machine" issue. This, in turn, 
            enhanced the portability of our project, making it easy for new team members such as myself to get up to speed without struggling with 
            complex environment configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Git Bash, a command-line interface for Git, was crucial for version control. It enabled us to track code changes, collaborate seamlessly, 
            and maintain a comprehensive history of our project. By working with Git Bash, we could create and manage branches, ensuring that different 
            developers could work on various features independently while also facilitating smooth code integration.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make version control even more accessible, we used GitHub Desktop, which provided a user-friendly graphical interface for Git. Its 
            integration with GitHub, our chosen platform for hosting repositories, streamlined tasks like pushing and pulling code, creating pull requests, 
            and reviewing changes. This user-friendly interface made Git more approachable, allowing team members who weren't command-line experts to 
            participate in version control effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Docker Desktop, Git Bash, and GitHub Desktop were indispensable in our development environment. They ensured consistency, promoted collaboration, 
            streamlined our workflows, and made our development process efficient and accessible to all team members. These tools were the backbone of our 
            project's success, allowing us to work together seamlessly and deliver a high-quality product.
        </p>
        <p class="section__subtitle">
            <strong>Phase Two: Solution</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kids Code Club website utilized a "tagging" system, which allowed tutorial creators to assign categories to their tutorials. However, due to the fact
            that they were only visual, it wasn't possible to directly incorporate them into a filtering system as is.
        </p>
        <img src="images/tag-example.png" alt="" class=".section__subtitle--intro">
        <p>
            I enhanced the tagging system on a website by making various modifications to the database structure, schema, and the components 
            that manage data and user interactions within the Laravel Framework. These modifications allowed me to expand the range of tags that 
            administrators can use on the site, offering them more diverse options, as well as assign the tags to the tutorials in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then integrated these behind-the-scenes adjustments into the website's front-end, which is what users see and interact with. I did this by working with HTML, PHP, 
            and CSS to ensure that the new tagging features were visible and functional for both administrators and regular users. This combined effort improved the website's tagging 
            system, making it more versatile and user-friendly.
